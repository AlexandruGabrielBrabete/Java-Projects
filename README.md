# Java Projects Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Java projects developed to demonstrate core and advanced programming concepts. The projects range from algorithmic implementations to complete GUI-based applications and are intended for educational and portfolio purposes.

All projects are written in standard Java and are compatible with JDK 8 and higher. The code is structured for clarity and modularity, allowing easy exploration and reuse.

## Projects

| Project Name           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AdvancedAES`          | An advanced implementation of the AES encryption algorithm. Includes manual byte-level operations and key expansion. |
| `AdvancedRSA`          | RSA public-key cryptography with support for key generation, encryption, and decryption using large primes. |
| `BitMaskRPG`           | A simple role-playing game that uses bitmasking techniques to manage inventory, status effects, and progression logic. |
| `CardGameGUI`          | A graphical card game application built using Java Swing, demonstrating OOP principles and event-driven programming. |
| `ChessGame`            | A full-featured chess game with GUI and rule enforcement. Handles piece logic, turn switching, and basic move validation. |
| `TicTacToeApp`         | A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface. Features basic AI and game state tracking. |
| `EncryptionAlgorithm`  | Custom encryption algorithm implementations for testing and learning cryptographic concepts. |
| `Documentation`        | Technical notes, design diagrams, and supplementary files related to the above projects. |

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- A Java-compatible IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code)
- I made this code using the Visual Studio Code compiler (which doesn't require package specification, unlike Intelli and Eclipse). The code is fully functional!
