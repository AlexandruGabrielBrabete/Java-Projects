# Java Projects Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Java projects developed to demonstrate core and advanced programming concepts. The projects range from algorithmic implementations to complete GUI-based applications and are intended for educational and portfolio purposes.

All projects are written in standard Java and are compatible with JDK 8 and higher. The code is structured for clarity and modularity, allowing easy exploration and reuse.

|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AdvancedAES**                | An advanced implementation of the AES encryption algorithm. Includes manual byte-level operations and key expansion.      |
| **AdvancedRSA**                | RSA public-key cryptography with support for key generation, encryption, and decryption using large primes.               |
| **BitMaskRPG**                 | A simple role-playing game that uses bitmasking techniques to manage inventory, status effects, and progression logic.    |
| **CardGameGUI**                | A graphical card game application built using Java Swing, demonstrating OOP principles and event-driven programming.      |
| **ChessGame**                  | A full-featured chess game with GUI and rule enforcement. Handles piece logic, turn switching, and basic move validation. |
| **TicTacToeApp**               | A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface. Features basic AI and game state tracking.                    |
| **EncryptionAlgorithm**        | Custom encryption algorithm implementations for testing and learning cryptographic concepts.     |
| **Calculator**                 | Swing‐based calculator with basic arithmetic, `%`, `±`, and clear functionality.                 |        
| **Tabbed Drawing App**         | Tabbed interface for drawing text and shapes with font, size and color controls.                 |        
| **RGB Slider Demo**            | RGB mixer with sliders and live preview panel showing the resulting color and RGB values.        |          
| **Reaction Time Tester**       | Measures user reaction to red/black circles over 10 rounds and reports correct count & timings.  |      
| **Bouncing Circle App**        | Animated panel with a circle bouncing off edges; Start/Stop control button.                      |     
| **GCD Multi-Thread App**       | Console app spawning threads to compute GCD of large integers, reporting performance stats.      |      
| **Shared File Read/Write App** | Two writer threads append timestamped messages; a reader thread tails the file in real time.     |   
| **Urn Simulation App**         | Graphical ticket‐drawing simulation with multiple players, sequential or with‐replacement modes. |          
| **Image Viewer App**           | Loads and scales images to fit; choose caption font and text color.                              |        
| **TV Test Pattern App**        | Renders a TV test pattern: 10 grayscale bands followed by 6 color bands filling the panel.       |        
| **Vehicle Animation App**      | Customizable vehicle animation with environment, weather toggles, and selectable color.          |      
| **Tangent Circles App**        | Packs non‐overlapping random circles tangent to each other across the panel.                     |        
| **Cannon Simulation App**      | Simulates firing a projectile with elastic bounces, drawing its trajectory and final velocity.   |     
| **Documentation**              | Technical notes, design diagrams, and supplementary files related to the above projects.         |

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- A Java-compatible IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code)
- I made this code using the Visual Studio Code compiler (which doesn't require package specification, unlike Intelli and Eclipse). The code is fully functional!
